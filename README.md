# Simple Pytorch-Lightning based Translation model training

This is a simple project to understand the basics of training a 
translation model (e.g., NLLB) using the pytorch-lightning
framework.

### Getting started

Setup a conda environment with Python 3.11.

Then run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then simply run the main function:
```bash
python main.py
